# 0xced.Templates

0xced's opinionated templates for `dotnet new`

## Installation

To install the templates (or update to the latest version), run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xced/0xced.Templates
dotnet new install --force 0xced.Templates
```

For more information about the `dotnet new` command, see the the official [dotnet new documentation][dotnet-new].

## The `nuget-classlib` template

The NuGet class library template creates a class library and everything needed for publishing on NuGet, including a GitHub Actions workflow. Compared to the built-in `classlib` template, the `nuget-classlib` provides many additional features.

To create a solution from this template, run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir MyGreatLibrary && cd MyGreatLibrary
dotnet new nuget-classlib
```

### Class library project

* üéØ Target .NET 8 which has [Long Term Support][LTS], i.e. is supported for three years after the initial release.
* ‚ùî Enable [nullable reference types][NRT] with `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` (same as the built-in `classlib` template).
* ‚ö†Ô∏è [Treat warnings as errors][TWAS], because ignoring warnings leads to bugs, and errors can't be ignored.
* üî¨ Enable all [.NET source code analysis][CodeAnalysis] rules with `<AnalysisMode>All</AnalysisMode>`.
  This can turn out rather extreme (especially with warning as errors) so be prepared to [suppress some warnings][SuppressWarnings] or maybe even [downgrade][AnalysisMode] from `All` to `Recommended` or `Minimum`.
* üìó Generate a [documentation file][XmlDoc]. Together with warnings as errors, forgetting a comment on a public member becomes a compilaiton error.
* üîó Integrate [Source Link][SourceLink] to make debugging the library a bliss. Also, with `<DebugType>embedded</DebugType>` so that having the NuGet package is enough to ensure a great debugging experience, even if your internet connection goes down.
* üì¶ Enable [package validation][PackageValidation] to ensure that a [breaking change][BreakingChanges] doesn't inadvertently slip in a minor or patch version.
* ‚ÑπÔ∏è Define all important metadata to follow the [package authoring best practices][PackageAuthoringBestPractices].
  * Authors
  * Copyright
  * Description
  * PackageIcon
  * [PackageReadmeFile][PackageReadmeFile]
  * PackageLicenseExpression
  * PackageTags
  * PackageProjectUrl
  * PackageReleaseNotes
  * PublishRepositoryUrl
* üè∑ Versioning with [MinVer][MinVer], the best .NET versioning tool.
* üîí Use a [lock file][LockFile] for repeatable restore.
* ‚úÖ Automatically validate that the package was produced by a [deterministic build][DeterministicBuild] and that Source Link is property configured.

### Test project

* üë©‚Äçüî¨ Code coverage with [coverlet][coverlet].
  * Running `dotnet test` automatically runs coverage, displays a summary on your terminal, generates an html report with [ReportGenerator][ReportGenerator] and opens it in your browser.
  * Deterministic report paths, working around [microsoft/vstest/#2378][VsTestIssue2378] (Avoid guid at the end of outputDirectory).
* ‚öîÔ∏è Using [xUnit.net][xUnit], the best unit testing tool of the .NET ecosystem.
* ‚öôÔ∏è Public API snapshot with [Verify][Verify] for easy review of your public API evolution.

### GitHub Actions workflow

The ***Continuous Integration*** workflow runs everytime a commit is pushed to the GitHub repository.

The ***Test Report*** workflow runs after ***Continuous Integration*** in order to produce a comprehensive test report dashboard with the summary of all tests.

A package (nupkg file) is always produced and available in the action artifacts. When the commit has an attached tag, which is required when using [MinVer][MinVer], the package is published on NuGet.

### The `package` job

The package job runs on Linux + macOS + Windows. This ensures the code is truly cross platform. `fail-fast` is set to`false` so that if an error occurs one one platform, other platforms continue to run the job.

This job builds the NuGet package and runs the unit tests.

The `checks: write` permission is granted for the [Test Reporter][TestReporter] to work properly with pull requests.

The following steps are performed.

* Chekout the git repository, with `fetch-depth: 0` so that MinVer can version pre-release versions correctly.
* Install the .NET SDK. No parameters are specified so that the SDK version from the `global.json` file is used. And since `latestFeature` is used as the roll forward policy, the [dotnet-install-script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is executed with `--channel` and the two-part version in A.B format.
* Taking advantage of the `packages.lock.json` file, NuGet package dependencies are retrived from a [cache](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows). If the packages are not in the cache anymore, they will be retrieved from nuget.org during the restore step.
* `dotnet restore` to restore the NuGet package dependencies.
* `dotnet build --no-restore` to build the solution (class library + tests).
* `dotnet test --no-build`  to run the tests.
* If the tests fail, all `**/*.received.*` files (produced by [Verify][Verify]) are uploaded as artifacts so that the can be analyzed.
* The test results hmtl report is always uploaded as an artifact.
* The [Test Reporter][TestReporter] action is run to make test results summary available directly on the action run.
* Code coverage results are uploaded to [Codecov][Codecov]. This requires to login to Codecov and setup the repositry first.
* If the `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret is defined in the repositry, code coverage results are also uplaoded to [Codacy][Codacy].
* `dotnet pack --no-build` is run to produce the NuGet package.
* The produced NuGet package is uploaded as an artifact.
* If the `STRYKER_DASHBOARD_API_KEY` secret is defined in the repositry, mutation testing is performed with [Stryker][Stryker] and the mutation results are uploaded to the Stryker dashboard.
* If a tag exists on the commit, release notes are extracted from the tag and a *Release Notes* artifact is uploaded.

### The `publish` job

When a tag is attached to the commit, the following steps are performed.

* The release notes artifact from the `package` job is downloaded and a GitHub release is created.
* The nupkg artifact from the `package` job is downloaded and pushed to NuGet. This requires the `NUGET_API_KEY` secret to be defined in the repository.

### Miscellaneous

*	Dependabot
*	README
*	CHANGELOG
*	Code of Conduct

## The `spectre-console` template

The Spectre Console template creates a console app powered by the [Spectre.Console.Cli](https://spectreconsole.net/cli/) package.

To create a project from this template, run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir mycli && cd mycli
dotnet new spectre-console
```

This template provides the following features.

* üî¢ Automatic  `--version` support using the [AssemblyInformationalVersion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assemblyinformationalversionattribute) attribute of the main assembly. The version can be controlled by setting the `<Version>1.2.3</Version>` property in the csproj.
* üéõÔ∏è A default command with just enough to get started with [settings](https://spectreconsole.net/cli/settings).
* üìÑ Redirection-friendy stdout and stderr. I.e. get nice interactive [spinners](https://spectreconsole.net/live/status) and [progress bars](https://spectreconsole.net/live/progress) while running in a terminal and ignore those when redirected to a file.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Cancellable commands with a cancellation token that triggers when Ctrl+C is pressed.
* üí£ A solid exception handler.
  * Exits with code 130 when Ctrl+C is pressed, code 64 (EX_USAGE) if the app is used incorrectly, code 70 (EX_SOFTWARE) in case of uncaught exception.
  * Pretty display of exceptions.
  * Writes the help page in case the app is misued.
